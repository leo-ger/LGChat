Current state of the project

Day 1:
Created the project. Implemented a simple chat functionality with a server which saves all connected Clients, gives
them a unique UID and forwards messages sent from a client to another one with a given UID. Also sets sender-UID to
the client who sent the message. I didn't look into encryption for now, but will in a short while.
